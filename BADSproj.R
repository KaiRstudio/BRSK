# ---- IDEAS ----
# 1)  In case someone buys more stuff at once, the whole thing should obviously not be 
#     discouraged because one or two items are likely to be returned
#     rather try to get the one item out of the cart
# 2)  the likelihood of an item being returned has to be seen in respect to how much
#     would be lost if discouraged and wouldnt have been returned. It is worse if cheap items
#     are returned than expensive ones, because percentage wise the return is more expensive
#     as well as its 3â‚¬ plus 10 % ov value.
